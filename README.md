# JavaScript Loose Equality Pitfalls with null and undefined

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from the use of loose equality (`==`) when comparing `null` and `undefined`.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug behavior, especially when dealing with optional parameters or values that might be absent.

## The Problem

In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` represent the absence of a value, but they are distinct.  Using loose equality (`==`) treats them as equivalent in certain circumstances, masking the underlying difference and potentially leading to logic errors.

## Solution

The best practice is to use strict equality (`===`) when comparing values.  Strict equality distinguishes between `null` and `undefined`, resulting in predictable behavior and reducing the risk of hidden bugs.
